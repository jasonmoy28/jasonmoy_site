      <description>At its core, this package allows people to analyze their data with one simple function call. For example, when you are running a linear regression, you need to fit the model, check the goodness of fit (e.g., R2), check the model assumption, and plot the interaction (if the interaction is included). Without this package, you need several packages to do the above steps. Additionally, if you are an R beginner, you probably donâ€™t know where to find all these R packages.</description>

Abstract: This study investigated the combined effects of national culture and perceptions of employability on relationships between job insecurity and work and non-work outcomes for individual employees. Data from 28,674 participants in 35 nations were obtained from the 2015 European Working Conditions Survey. Results showed that nation-level differences in individualism/collectivism (I/C), uncertainty avoidance (UA), and masculinity/femininity (M/F) accounted for variation in the degree to which perceptions of employability buffered the negative effects of job insecurity on job satisfaction, work engagement, and subjective well-being.</description>

      <description>I am a first-year PhD student in Organizational Behavior at University of Washington Michael G. Foster School of Business. Prior to joining Foster, I earned an MSc in Human Resources and Organizations at London School of Economics and a B.S. in Psychology at University of California San Diego. My research interest is primarily focuses on cultural-related OB. Specifically, I am interested in researching 1) cultural diversity and managing multicultural teams, 2) the benefits (or costs) of working, studying, living in multiple cultures, and 3) how culture shapes people&amp;rsquo;s behaviors.</description>
