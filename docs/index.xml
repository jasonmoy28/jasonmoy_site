      <description>At its core, this package allows people to analyze their data with one simple function call. For example, when you are running a linear regression, you need to fit the model, check the goodness of fit (e.g., R2), check the model assumption, and plot the interaction (if the interaction is included). Without this package, you need several packages to do the above steps. Additionally, if you are an R beginner, you probably donâ€™t know where to find all these R packages.</description>

      <description>-- I am a second-year PhD student in Organizational Behavior at Foster School of Business, University of Washington. Prior to joining Foster, I earned an MSc in Human Resources and Organizations at London School of Economics (LSE) and a B.S. in Psychology at University of California San Diego (UCSD).
My research interest primarily focuses on how societal and cultural norms as well as multicultural experiences shape individuals&amp;rsquo; behaviors. Beyond my research, I have also created an R package (pscyModel) that aim to make statistical analysis in R simpler.</description>
