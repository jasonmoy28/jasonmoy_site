I am a first-year PhD student in Organizational Behavior at University of Washington Michael G. Foster School of Business. Prior to joining Foster, I earned an MSc in Human Resources and Organizations at London School of Economics and a B.S. in Psychology at University of California San Diego.

My research interest is primarily focuses on cultural-related OB. Specifically, I am interested in researching 1) cultural diversity and managing multicultural teams, 2) the benefits (or costs) of working, studying, living in multiple cultures, and 3) how culture shapes people's behaviors. Additionally, I am also interested in researching the impact of remote working on employees' well-being and behaviors.

Beyond research, I have also created two R packages that aim to make statistical analysis in R simpler. The first one is [pyscModel](https://jasonmoy28.github.io/psycModel/) which is currently distributed through CRAN. It is a beginner-friendly R package for statistical analysis in social science. The second one is [psycCleaning](https://github.com/jasonmoy28/psycCleaning) which is available through my GitHub. As the name indicated, this package help you to do data cleaning more easily.
