Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Organizational Behavior at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington. My research interest primarily centers on how societal and cultural norms shape individuals' behaviors and the work experiences of underprivileged individuals. Beyond my research, I have also developed an R package ([pscyModel](https://jasonmoy28.github.io/psycModel/)) aimed at simplifying statistical analysis in R. It is currently distributed through [CRAN](https://jasonmoy28.github.io/psycModel/), and the development version can be accessed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonmoy28/psycModel).

Before joining Foster, I earned an MSc in Human Resources and Organizations from the London School of Economics (LSE) and a B.S. in Psychology from the University of California San Diego (UCSD).
