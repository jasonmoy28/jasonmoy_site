I am a second-year PhD student in Organizational Behavior at Foster School of Business, University of Washington. Prior to joining Foster, I earned an MSc in Human Resources and Organizations at London School of Economics (LSE) and a B.S. in Psychology at University of California San Diego (UCSD).

My research interest primarily focuses on how societal and cultural norms as well as multicultural experiences shape individuals' behaviors. Beyond my research, I have also created an R package ([pscyModel](https://jasonmoy28.github.io/psycModel/)) that aim to make statistical analysis in R simpler. It is currently distributed through [CRAN](https://jasonmoy28.github.io/psycModel/) and the dev version is available through my [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonmoy28/psycModel).
