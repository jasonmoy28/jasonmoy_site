      <description>At its core, this package allows people to analyze their data with one simple function call. For example, when you are running a linear regression, you need to fit the model, check the goodness of fit (e.g., R2), check the model assumption, and plot the interaction (if the interaction is included). Without this package, you need several packages to do the above steps. Additionally, if you are an R beginner, you probably donâ€™t know where to find all these R packages.</description>

      <description>Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Organizational Behavior at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington. My research interest primarily centers on how societal and cultural norms shape individuals&amp;rsquo; behaviors and the work experiences of underprivileged individuals. Beyond my research, I have also developed an R package (pscyModel) aimed at simplifying statistical analysis in R. It is currently distributed through CRAN, and the development version can be accessed on my GitHub.</description>
